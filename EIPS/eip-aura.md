## Simple Summary
Aura is a basic consensus algorithm where only a defined set of users _mine_ blocks.

## Abstract
Aura (_Authority Round_) is a proof-of-authority blockchain consensus algorithm where only a defined set of validators is allowed to seal blocks. It's a protocol where instead of miners racing to find a solution to a difficult problem, authorized signers can create new blocks in a round-robin process at defined intervals.

Aura is the consensus engine pioneered by [Parity Technologies](https://parity.io) in 2016 and used to power the [public Kovan testnet](https://medium.com/@Digix/announcing-kovan-a-stable-ethereum-public-testnet-10ac7cb6c85f) which was established after the [Ropsten spam-attacks](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/12477/ropsten-testnet-is-under-kind-of-attack-what-can-we-do) in 2017. Besides, public value-bearing networks, such as the [POA Network](https://poa.network/), are based on the Aura protocol today.

This document is _informational_ and summarizes the available technical specification of the consensus engine. This provides other client developer teams an overview, a place for feedback and potentially the foundation to implement this in other code bases.

## Motivation
Networks bearing no value cannot be sufficiently secured with proof-of-work or proof-of-stake. This circumstance is uniquely right for test networks that are supposed to be a reliable platform for developers to deploy and test their applications. Therefore, a proof-of-authority scheme is proposed which provides sufficient resistance against network attacks in testnets without any value attached.

## Specification
The following sections technically specify the Authority Round consensus protocol.

### Parameters
  - `n`, the number of validator nodes
  - `f`, the number of faulty validator nodes
  - `s`, the step ID
  - `t`, the step duration in seconds
  - `h`, the height of the chain with the highest score
  - `C[K]`, the chain `C` at some denoted block `K`

### Authority Round Description
Time is divided into discrete steps of duration `t`, determined by:

![Formula 00](../assets/eip-aura/00-unix-time.png)

At each step `s`, a _primary_ is assigned. Only the _primary_ at a step may issue a block. Producing more than one block per step or producing a block out of turn is bad behavior. The _primary_ for a step `s` is the validator node with index:

![Formula 01](../assets/eip-aura/01-s-bmod-n.png)

The protocol contains a chain scoring rule `SCORE(C)` for a given chain `C`. At each step, all the honest nodes propagate the chain with the highest score to all the other nodes. Honest primaries only issue blocks on top of the best chain they are aware of during their turn.

### Sealing

The seal is part of the block header and appended accordingly. For Parity Ethereum, this is:

```rust
/// Place the header into an RLP stream `s`, optionally `with_seal`.
fn stream_rlp(&self, s: &mut RlpStream, with_seal: Seal) {
	if let Seal::With = with_seal {
		s.begin_list(13 + self.seal.len());
	} else {
		s.begin_list(13);
	}

	s.append(&self.parent_hash);
	s.append(&self.uncles_hash);
	s.append(&self.author);
	s.append(&self.state_root);
	s.append(&self.transactions_root);
	s.append(&self.receipts_root);
	s.append(&self.log_bloom);
	s.append(&self.difficulty);
	s.append(&self.number);
	s.append(&self.gas_limit);
	s.append(&self.gas_used);
	s.append(&self.timestamp);
	s.append(&self.extra_data);

	if let Seal::With = with_seal {
		for b in &self.seal {
			s.append_raw(b, 1);
		}
	}
}
```

### Finality
Under the assumption of a synchronous network which propagates messages within the step duration `t`, let `SIG_SET(B)` be the set of signatures from all authors in the set of blocks `B`:

![Formula 02](../assets/eip-aura/02-sig-set-b.png)

If there is a valid chain `C` ending with `C[K..]`, where:

![Formula 03](../assets/eip-aura/03-sig-set-ck.png)

then `C[K]` and all of its ancestors are finalized. This definition of finality stems from a simple majority vote. In this setting:

![Formula 04](../assets/eip-aura/04-2f-leq-n.png)

the faulty node cannot finalize a block alone.

### Configuration
This consensus requires a _Validator Set_ to be specified, which determines the list of `n` blockchain addresses at each height `h` which participate in the consensus. Validators are a group of accounts which are allowed to participate in the consensus; they validate the transactions and blocks, signing messages about them later.

The validator set can be specified in different ways. To implement a basic Authority Round engine, an _immutable list_ is sufficient. However, optionally, it can be dynamically provided by smart contracts containing the validator sets. Multisets as implemented in Parity Ethereum even allow combining hard-forking from immutable to dynamic validator sets.

#### Immutable list
A simple list of addresses specified at genesis, i.e.:

```json
"validators": {
    "list": [
        "0x0082a7bf6aaadab094061747872243059c3c6a07",
        "0x00faa37564140c1a5e96095f05466b9f73441e44"
    ]
}
```

#### Contracts
_(Optional:)_ The list can also be a part of the blockchain state by being stored in an Ethereum contract.

It is best to include the contract in the genesis, placing the bytecode as a "constructor" in the "accounts" field. If the constructor takes arguments, they must be encoded and appended to the contract bytecode (using, e.g., [`ethabi`](https://github.com/paritytech/ethabi)). Also if the contract initializes any address with `msg.sender` (for example as a contract owner) you must take into account that when defining the contract in genesis, `msg.sender` is set to the system address (`SYSTEM_ADDRESS`: `2^160 - 2`).

Example contracts can be found here with the [contract used on Kovan Network](https://github.com/parity-contracts/kovan-validator-set).

##### Non-reporting contract
A simple validator contract has to have the following interface:
```json
[{"constant":false,"inputs":[],"name":"finalizeChange","outputs":[],"payable":false,"type":"function"},{"constant":true,"inputs":[],"name":"getValidators","outputs":[{"name":"_validators","type":"address[]"}],"payable":false,"type":"function"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":true,"name":"_parent_hash","type":"bytes32"},{"indexed":false,"name":"_new_set","type":"address[]"}],"name":"InitiateChange","type":"event"}]
```

which corresponds to this Solidity contract definition:
```solidity
contract ValidatorSet {
    /// Issue this log event to signal a desired change in validator set.
    /// This will not lead to a change in active validator set until
    /// finalizeChange is called.
    ///
    /// Only the last log event of any block can take effect.
    /// If a signal is issued while another is being finalized it may never
    /// take effect.
    ///
    /// _parent_hash here should be the parent block hash, or the
    /// signal will not be recognized.
    event InitiateChange(bytes32 indexed _parent_hash, address[] _new_set);

    /// Get current validator set (last enacted or initial if no changes ever made)
    function getValidators() constant returns (address[] _validators);

    /// Called when an initiated change reaches finality and is activated.
    /// Only valid when msg.sender == SUPER_USER (EIP96, 2**160 - 2)
    ///
    /// Also called when the contract is first enabled for consensus. In this case,
    /// the "change" finalized is the activation of the initial set.
    function finalizeChange();
}
```

There is a notion of an "active" validator set: this is the set of the most recently finalized signal (`InitiateChange` event) or the initial set if no changes have been finalized. The function `getValidators` should always return the active set or the initial set if the contract hasn't been activated yet.

Switching the set should be done by issuing an `InitiateChange` event with the parent block hash and the new set. Storing the pending set, and then waiting for a call to `finalizeChange` (by the `SYSTEM_ADDRESS`: `2^160 - 2`) before setting the active set to the pending set. This mechanism is used to ensure that the previous validator set "signs off" on the changes before activation, leading to full security in situations like warp and light sync, where state transitions aren't checked.

Other than these restrictions, the switching rules are fully determined by the contract implementing that method. The spec should contain the contract address:

```json
"validators": {
    "safeContract": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000009"
}
```

##### Reporting contract
Sometimes one might want to take action automatically when one of the validators misbehaves. The definition of bad behaviour depends on a consensus engine, and there are two types of bad behaviour:
- benign misbehaviour
- malicious misbehaviour

Benign misbehaviour in Aura may be simply not receiving a block from a designated primary, while malicious misbehaviour would be releasing two different blocks in the same step. This type of contract can listen to misbehaviour reports from the consensus engine and decide what the consequences for the validators are.

The correct interface is:
```json
[{"constant":false,"inputs":[],"name":"finalizeChange","outputs":[],"payable":false,"type":"function"},{"constant":true,"inputs":[],"name":"getValidators","outputs":[{"name":"_validators","type":"address[]"}],"payable":false,"type":"function"},{"constant":false,"inputs":[{"name":"validator","type":"address"},{"name":"blockNumber","type":"uint256"},{"name":"proof","type":"bytes"}],"name":"reportMalicious","outputs":[],"payable":false,"type":"function"},{"constant":false,"inputs":[{"name":"validator","type":"address"},{"name":"blockNumber","type":"uint256"}],"name":"reportBenign","outputs":[],"payable":false,"type":"function"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":true,"name":"_parent_hash","type":"bytes32"},{"indexed":false,"name":"_new_set","type":"address[]"}],"name":"InitiateChange","type":"event"}]
```

which corresponds to this Solidity contract definition:
```solidity
contract ReportingValidatorSet {
    // all same as ValidatorSet
    event InitiateChange(bytes32 indexed _parent_hash, address[] _new_set);
    function getValidators() constant returns (address[] _validators);
    function finalizeChange();

    // Reporting functions: operate on current validator set.
    // malicious behavior requires proof, which varies by the engine.
    function reportBenign(address validator, uint256 blockNumber);
    function reportMalicious(address validator, uint256 blockNumber, bytes proof);
}
```

`InitiateChange`, `getValidators` and `finalizeChange` should function exactly as in a non-reporting contract.

There are two new functions, `reportBenign` and `reportMalicious`. Each should come with the address of a validator being reported and the block number at which misbehavior occurred. `reportMalicious` also requires a proof of malice, which is an arbitrary byte-string which different engines set to different values. Validators call these when they detect misbehavior. These should function on only the current active validator set.

It is specified as:

```json
"validators": {
    "contract": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000009"
}
```

#### Multiset
_(Optional:)_ This validator set can specify any combination of other validator sets. Switching is done based on the number of the current block. It can be useful for conducting chain forks. The first set has to start at block 0.

```json
"validators": {
    "multi": {
        "0": {
            "list": [
                "0x82a978b3f5962a5b0957d9ee9eef472ee55b42f1",
                "0x7d577a597b2742b498cb5cf0c26cdcd726d39e6e"
            ]
        },
        "100": {
            "contract": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000009"
        }
    }
}
```

Note that transitions to a contract won't take effect immediately. Rather, they take effect when the previous set of validators finalizes the block. Again, this is to provide full security for warp and light sync. Transitions to a fixed list take effect immediately because regardless of whether an attacker gives a light client a transition block with an invalid state, the subsequent validator set is always the same.

#### Limitations

Currently, events emitted by the validator set contract when the engine calls `finalizeChange` are not observable. This circumstance is a limitation of how "system" transactions are implemented at the moment.

### Supplementary features
_(Optional:)_ The consensus can be run with _force-sealing_ which ensures that blocks are produced at each step `s` after step duration `t` even if there are no transactions. This approach would be necessary for blocks to reach finality in a timely fashion. If malicious authorities are possible, then force-sealing is advised. This ensures that the correct chain is the longest (making it Byzantine-Fault Tolerant with the finality of `n * t` given no network partitions).

_(Optional:)_ To reach finality in a timely fashion it is necessary for the nodes to keep sealing blocks even when there are no transactions. To reduce blockchain bloat while still maintaining the same finality guarantees, the nodes can sign and broadcast an `EmptyStep(s, parent_hash)` message instead of producing an empty block. All of the nodes accumulate the broadcasted empty step messages, and they are included and rewarded in the next non-empty block. The empty step messages included in blocks are also taken into account for finality. The maximum number of empty steps should be limited and configurable.

_(Optional:)_ The maximum number of accepted ommers should be limited and configurable. While Ethash defaults to `2`, it's recommended to default Aura engines to a maximum of `0` ommers to avoid unnecessary chain reorgs.

## Rationale
An alternate proof-of-authority standard is [_Clique_ proposed by Péter Szilágyi in March 2017](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/225). The Clique engine is implemented in Geth and powering the [Rinkeby test network](https://www.rinkeby.io/).

## Implementation
The Parity Ethereum client contains a [feature-complete implementation of the Aura engine](https://wiki.parity.io/Pluggable-Consensus). The public Kovan testnet can be regarded as [show-case for Aura](https://kovan-stats.parity.io/).
